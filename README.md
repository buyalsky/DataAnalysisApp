# Data Analysis App
Data Analysis App is a [no-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-code_development_platform) platform which includes GUI 
for users who have no data analysis and machine learning knowledge in order to give ability to perform those tasks
without programming.

There is another great available open source project that lets you apply more complex Data mining and ML applications 
called [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

Unlike Weka, Data Analysis App is more beginner oriented. It has less features and concise configuration options for 
the sake of simplicity that often comes with less control.

Project name is too broad. I am very bad at naming so lets keep as `Data Analysis App` for now.

#### Note that the project still under development and has bugs that needs to be resolved.

## Prerequisites
This application requires Python 3.6 or above.

Also you need to have following dependencies installed:
* PyQt5 or PySide2
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

## Features
1. Data analysis
2. Classification
3. Clustering
4. Visualization

## Usage
Simply run main_window.py with your Python 3 interpreter:

```
python3 main_window.py
```

### I'll update usage chapter more specifically soon.
